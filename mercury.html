<h1>Mercury – The Swiftest Planet</h1>

<p>
Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our Solar System. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers and completes one full revolution in just 88 Earth days. Because of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury moves faster than any other planet, which is why it was named after the Roman messenger god known for speed.
</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

<p>
Mercury has a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers, making it only slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. Its surface is rocky and heavily cratered, resembling the Moon in appearance. Billions of years ago, intense asteroid impacts shaped its rugged terrain. Large impact basins, such as the Caloris Basin, stretch across vast areas of the planet’s surface.
</p>

<p>
Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet—that distinction belongs to Venus. However, Mercury experiences the most extreme temperature variations of any planet. Daytime temperatures can rise to about 430°C, while nighttime temperatures can drop to -180°C. These drastic changes occur because Mercury has almost no atmosphere to retain heat.
</p>

<h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>

<p>
Mercury has a unique rotational pattern. It rotates three times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun, a phenomenon known as a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. One day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days. This slow rotation contributes to the planet’s extreme temperature fluctuations.
</p>

<p>
Its orbit is also highly elliptical compared to other planets, meaning its distance from the Sun varies significantly. This affects both its speed and the intensity of solar radiation it receives.
</p>

<h2>Internal Structure</h2>

<p>
Mercury has a disproportionately large iron core that makes up nearly 85% of its radius. This massive metallic core generates a weak magnetic field, which is unusual for such a small planet. Scientists believe Mercury may once have been much larger, but a massive collision early in its history might have stripped away much of its outer layers.
</p>

<h2>Surface Features</h2>

<p>
The surface of Mercury is covered with impact craters, ridges, and cliffs called lobate scarps. These scarps formed as the planet cooled and contracted over billions of years. Some cliffs stretch hundreds of kilometers long and rise several kilometers high.
</p>

<p>
Recent discoveries have also revealed the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters near Mercury’s poles. Even though the planet is extremely hot overall, these regions never receive direct sunlight, allowing ice deposits to remain stable.
</p>

<h2>Atmosphere (Exosphere)</h2>

<p>
Mercury does not have a thick atmosphere like Earth. Instead, it has an extremely thin exosphere composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Because it is so thin, gases escape easily into space, offering little protection from solar radiation or meteoroids.
</p>

<h2>Exploration History</h2>

<p>
Mercury has been visited by only a few spacecraft missions due to the difficulty of reaching it. NASA’s Mariner 10 mission in the 1970s provided the first close-up images. Decades later, the MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, mapping its surface and studying its composition in detail. Currently, the BepiColombo mission, a joint project between Europe and Japan, is on its way to further investigate Mercury’s mysteries.
</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mercury has no moons or rings.</li>
<li>It has the most eccentric orbit of any planet.</li>
<li>A year on Mercury is shorter than its day.</li>
<li>Despite being closest to the Sun, Venus is hotter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Mercury may be small, but it plays an important role in helping scientists understand planetary formation and extreme space environments. Its massive iron core, unusual rotation, and temperature extremes make it one of the most fascinating worlds in our Solar System.
